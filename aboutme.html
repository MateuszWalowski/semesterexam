    <h1>Welcome</h1>

   <p>From the first time I put my hands on a pencil I realised my thing was Illustration. <br />I attended the Academy of Visual Arts in Argentina <br /> where I majored in Art History, before I started travelling. <br /> I spent a year living in Denmark, and Copenhagen had a great impact on me. <br /> I moved to Spain right after that, with a refreshed sense of inspiration. <br />

    I am absolutely in love with Pixel Art! <br />
    
    I easily switch between digital art and ink and paper, <br /> I am not afraid of experimenting!  </p>

       <h1>Pixel artists are everywhere</h1>

       <p>
           The Pixel Art Niche is made up of people from every corner of the planet. I was first introduced to this genre by a friend that at the time was based in Tokyo. Like him and me, most pixel artists I’ve met have a lot in common except their location.

       <p>Movies that inspired me when I was young, were at the same time inspiring tons of other young minds I would meet in my late 20’s.</p>

       Video-Games

       Pixel art and 80s graphics are two very popular artstyle directions in the indie game market.
       Big demand for independent video game graphic designers corresponds with the growth of the indie game scene.

       Many developers in the indie scene work on both graphics and game engine and choose pixel art graphics because of its simplicity.

       Notable examples of games with pixel art style:

       Hotline Miami (2012)
       Fez (2012)
       FTL: Faster Than Light (2012)
       Shovel Knight (2014)
       Noita (2019)



       Maniac Mansion

       Music

       Music in this community identifies with an era that has been romanticised/yearned for in the past few years since the premiere of Stranger Things. Pixel art is also very popular in music videos since the rise of synthwave, darkwave and similar genres and subgenres in the late 2000s. These are heavily influenced by the 80s electronic music scene, just like pixel art is influenced by 80s game graphics.

       Because of that similarly,  those two scenes are intertwined and have similar target audiences and that’s why artists working on those genres of music often include pixel art elements in their music videos, album covers or other elements of their visual identity.


       Listen to this song.



       Watch how I combined the music with my art. Special Thanks to Matt Valo.
