    <h1>Welcome</h1>

   <p>From the first time I put my hands on a pencil I realised my thing was Illustration. <br />I attended the Academy of Visual Arts in Argentina <br /> where I majored in Art History, before I started travelling. <br /> I spent a year living in Denmark, and Copenhagen had a great impact on me. <br /> I moved to Spain right after that, with a refreshed sense of inspiration. <br />

    I am absolutely in love with Pixel Art! <br />
    
    I easily switch between digital art and ink and paper, <br /> I am not afraid of experimenting!  </p>

       <h1>Pixel artists are everywhere</h1>

       <h2>
           The Pixel Art Niche is made up of people from every corner of the planet. I was first introduced to this genre by a friend that at the time was based in Tokyo. Like him and me, most pixel artists I’ve met have a lot in common except their location.

       <h2>Movies</h2>

       <p>Movies that inspired me when I was young, were at the same time inspiring tons of other young minds I would meet in my late 20’s.</p>

       <h1>Video-Games</h1>

       <p>
           Pixel art and 80s graphics are two very popular artstyle directions in the indie game market.
           Big demand for independent video game graphic designers corresponds with the growth of the indie game scene.
       </p>

       <p>Many developers in the indie scene work on both graphics and game engine and choose pixel art graphics because of its simplicity.</p>

       <p>
           Notable examples of games with pixel art style:

           <ul>
               <li>
                   Hotline Miami (2012)
               </li>
               <li>
                   Fez (2012)
               </li>
               <li>
                   FTL: Faster Than Light (2012)
               </li>
               <li>
                   Shovel Knight (2014)
               </li>
               <li>
                   Noita (2019)
               </li>

           </ul>
       </p>

       <h1>Music</h1>

       <p>
           Music in this community identifies with an era that has been romanticised/yearned for in the past few years since the premiere of Stranger Things. Pixel art is also very popular in music videos since the rise of synthwave, darkwave and similar genres and subgenres in the late 2000s. These are heavily influenced by the 80s electronic music scene, just like pixel art is influenced by 80s game graphics.
       </p>
       <p>
           Because of that similarly,  those two scenes are intertwined and have similar target audiences and that’s why artists working on those genres of music often include pixel art elements in their music videos, album covers or other elements of their visual identity.
       </p>

       <p> Listen to this song.</p>



       <p><p> Watch how I combined the music with my art. Special Thanks to Matt Valo.</p></p>

       <h1>Do you <3 PIXEL ART? START MAKING YOUR OWN!</h1>
       <h2>Making Pixel Art in 3 Simple Steps</h2>
       <h3>
           First.
           Find a theme.
       </h3>
       <p>
           When I am starting a new project I usually search for my inspiration looking at old movies that portray futuristic worlds. My big time favourite is Blade Runner.
           Galaxies
       </p>
       <h3>
           Second.
           Outlines.
       </h3>
       <p>
           Once I have chosen a scene or landscape I want to transform into pixels, the first thing I do is I draw an outline of the elements present in it. I make outlines of the features that I want to recreate. Sometimes I use screenshots and sometimes I use my own drawings.
           Galaxies
       </p>
       <h3>
           Third.
           Foundation colors.
       </h3>

       <h2>FREE tools to help you start making pixel art</h2>
       <p>There are several free online tools you can use for making pixel art. In complexity and the amount of options they offer.</p>
       <p>
           These are in my opinion the best there are out there:
           <ul>


               <li>Make Pixel Art - In-browser pixel art editor. It’s very basic but an awesome choice as an introduction to the more complex software.</li>

               <li>
                   PiskelApp - Pixel editor with special focus on sprite animation. It allows you to save your work and it’s available both in the browser and as downloadable software.
               </li>
               <li>
                   GrafX2 - Bitmap paint software that includes a number of tools and effects that make it especially useful for designing game graphics, pixel art and sprite sheets. Its interface is based on Deluxe Paint, an old-timey graphic editor from 1985.
               </li>
               <li>
                   GIMP - open-source image software, it’s layout and functionality resembles Photoshop. The most complex program on this list since it has many other uses besides creating pixel art.
               </li>
           </ul> 
           Personally, Piskel is definitely the one I would recommend because of its very simple user interface. It also supports features such as saving your work online and it even has an app you can download on your own computer. Feel free to try them all and see which one is better for you. I would love to hear YOUR opinion.
