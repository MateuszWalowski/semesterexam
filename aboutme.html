   <p>From the first time I put my hands on a pencil I realised my thing was Illustration. I attended the Academy of Visual Arts in Argentina where I majored in Art History, before I started travelling. I spent a year living in Denmark, and Copenhagen had a great impact on me. I moved to Spain right after that, with a refreshed sense of inspiration. 

    I am absolutely in love with Pixel Art! 
    
    I easily switch between digital art and ink and paper, I am not afraid of experimenting!  </p>
